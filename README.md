# Rock Paper Scissors 2.0 ü™®üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a simple JavaScript game created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project** curriculum. This is my third project, now featuring a minimal **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to improve user interaction. The project helps refine my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How to Play  

1. Click one of the buttons (**Rock, Paper, or Scissors**) to make your selection.  
2. The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.  
3. The result of each round will be displayed on the webpage.  
4. The first player to reach **5 wins** is declared the overall winner.  
5. Once the game ends, scores reset automatically for a new match.
