# Rock Paper Scissors

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a simple JavaScript game created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project** curriculum. This is my third project, designed to practice and refine my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including functions, loops, and user interaction via `prompt()` and `console.log()`.

## How to Play

1. Open the **index.html** file in a web browser.
2. When the first prompt appears, **click "Cancel"** to close it.
3. Open the **Developer Tools**:
   - **Windows/Linux:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `F12`
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Option + I`
   - Or, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** â†’ Navigate to the **Console** tab.
4. **Reload the page** (`Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R`) to restart the game.
5. The game will prompt you to enter **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
6. The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
7. The result of each round will be displayed in the **console**.
8. The game consists of five rounds, and the final score will also be displayed in the **console**.

## Features

- **JavaScript-Based Gameplay:** Implements the core logic of Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript.
- **Best-of-Five Rounds:** The game plays five rounds and determines the overall winner.
- **Randomized AI Opponent:** The computer makes a random selection each round.
- **Console-Based Output:** Displays results and score updates in the browser console.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Basic structure for running the game in a browser.
- **JavaScript:** Handles game logic, user input, and computer choice generation.

---

## Project Structure

### Files and Directories
- `index.html`: The main HTML file to launch the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing game logic.

---

## Learning Objectives

This project was built with the following objectives:
1. **Understanding JavaScript Basics:** Strengthen my foundational skills in functions, loops, and conditionals.
2. **Implementing User Interaction:** Use `prompt()` for player input and `console.log()` for displaying results.
3. **Handling Game Logic:** Learn how to structure and compare user and computer choices to determine a winner.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Replace `prompt()` with buttons and display results dynamically on the webpage.
- **Enhance User Experience:** Include animations, sound effects, and a score tracker.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Ensure smooth gameplay on different screen sizes.
